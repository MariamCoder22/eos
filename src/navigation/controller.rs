// src/navigation/controller.rs
// Executes navigation commands by sending motor actions to the robot.
// Imports shared NavCommand type from lib.rs.

use log::info;

// Controller struct to handle motor commands.
// Currently a placeholder; will integrate with ROS 2 publisher.
pub struct Controller;

impl Controller {
    // Creates a new controller instance.
    pub fn new() -> Self {

    }

    // Executes a navigation command by logging it (placeholder for ROS 2 integration).
    // - cmd: Navigation command with linear/angular velocities.
    // In production, sends to /cmd_vel via Publisher.
    pub fn execute(&self, cmd: &NavCommand) {
        info!(

        // Future: Send to ROS 2 /cmd_vel topic (handled by publisher.rs)
    }
}

// SWOT Analysis
// Strengths:
// - Simplicity: Minimal implementation ensures MVP compiles and runs.
// - Extensibility: Easy to integrate with Publisher for real motor control.
// - Logging: Uses env_logger for debugging, aiding demo preparation.
//
// Weaknesses:
// - Placeholder Logic: No actual motor control; only logs commands.
// - Limited Functionality: Lacks integration with ROS 2 /cmd_vel in MVP.
// - No Feedback: Doesn’t handle robot state (e.g., odometry) for closed-loop control.
//
// Opportunities:
// - ROS 2 Integration: Link to publisher.rs for real-time motor commands in Gazebo.
// - Feedback Loop: Add odometry processing for precise navigation, enhancing demo.
// - Z Fellows Appeal: Basic structure shows intent for spatial control, improvable post-MVP.
//
// Threats:
// - Incomplete Demo: Lack of real control may weaken Gazebo demo impact for Z Fellows.
// - Complexity Increase: Adding full motor control requires ROS 2 expertise, risking delays.
// - Competition: ROS 2’s Nav2 controller is more robust, potentially overshadowing Eos.
