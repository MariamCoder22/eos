// src/navigation/planner.rs
// Plans navigation paths using SNN outputs for adaptive robot navigation.

// Imports dependencies and shared types.
// - Snn: Neural network for decision-making.
// - SensorData, NavCommand: Shared types from lib.rs.
use crate::{Snn, SensorData, NavCommand};

/// Planner struct to integrate SNN and generate navigation plans.
pub struct Planner {
    snn: Snn, // SNN for processing sensor data
}

impl Planner {
    /// Creates a new planner with the given SNN.
    pub fn new(snn: Snn) -> Self {
        Planner { snn }
    }

    /// Plans a navigation path based on sensor data.
    /// - `data`: LIDAR data from Subscriber.
    /// Returns a `NavCommand` (linear/angular velocities).
    pub fn plan(&self, data: &SensorData) -> NavCommand {
        // Delegate to SNN for decision-making
        // In MVP, SNN handles basic obstacle avoidance logic
        self.snn.process(data)
    }
}

// SWOT Analysis
// Strengths:
// - Modularity: Separates planning logic from SNN, enabling easy upgrades (e.g., A* algorithm).
// - Simplicity: Lightweight for MVP, integrates with SNN and ROS 2 for Gazebo demo.
// - Z Fellows Appeal: Shows navigation focus, aligning with robotics market needs ($10B).
//
// Weaknesses:
// - Basic Logic: Relies entirely on SNN; no advanced path planning (e.g., SLAM, A*).
// - Limited Scope: Only handles obstacle avoidance, not full spatial mapping.
// - Dependency on SNN: Weak SNN implementation limits planning effectiveness.
//
// Opportunities:
// - Algorithm Expansion: Add SLAM or RRT for robust spatial navigation in future iterations.
// - Traction Potential: Clear planning logic attracts robotics developers for GitHub stars.
// - Scalability: Can integrate with complex environments (e.g., multi-robot systems).
//
// Threats:
// - Oversimplification: Basic planning may not impress Z Fellows compared to ROS 2â€™s navigation stack.
// - Competition: Established ROS 2 planners (e.g., Nav2) are more feature-rich, risking irrelevance.
// - Debugging Complexity: Errors in SNN output may propagate to planner, hard to trace.
